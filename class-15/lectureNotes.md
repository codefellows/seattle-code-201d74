# Lecture Notes

## Preparing for project week

### Git Setup
- making a repo - one member will make a repo or you can make an organization
- all other members will need to have access as collaborators or org members - WRITE
- Decide if you will have a protected deployment/main branch vs a development or staging branch
- decide on a branch naming convention and a system to prevent merge conflicts

## Project Organization
- trello
- github projects
- other project management tools

## Merge Conflicts
- try to prevent by using good communication, commiting and pulling down regularly, and only having on computer touch a file at a time.
- merge conflicts will occur so lets learn how to handle them!

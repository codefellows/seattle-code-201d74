# Presentation Day Logistics

These tips were recommended by a recruiter who came and watched our presentations. There may be people in the audience who will be future job contacts, make sure you impress them!

## Guiding Principle
- Behave as if your future employer is watching.

## Dress-code:  
- Elevated dress is recommended. (We‚Äôre talking business casual vs. a pajama top/hoodie)

## Professionality: 
- No eating/drinking on camera üçî . 
- Mute yourself when not talking.
- Be aware of ‚Äòfiller‚Äô speech when presenting. "umm, like, so"

## Camera etiquette: 
- Cameras and Mics off if your team is not presenting.
- Try not to wiggle around, be aware of your face and body when your camera is on.

## ‚ÄúPassing the mic‚Äù: 
- ‚ÄúNAME, I‚Äôll pass it over to you‚Äù practice this in your run throughs so you will do it on presentation day.

## QA 
- I will watch the chat and Q&A for questions and moderate for you. I will try to evenly distribute questions but will also give you the opportunity to add to what someone else said.

## Logistics 
- use the link sent to **YOU** in your email to log in to the zoom call. 
- Double check today that you have that link, if not let me know so I can get you one. 
- Do not share your link with someone else
- **DO** invite your friends and family using this link https://www.eventbrite.com/e/201-virtual-demo-day-presentations-tickets-141901113049?aff=slack
- We present at 1:30pm. You need to be in the slack channel BY 1:15. Please do not be late, it causes stress on Sian and on your team, and me! This allows us time to check mics and be ready to roll right at 130.

## What to expect
- We will begin with all cameras on so that attendees can see you.
- I will welcome attendees and let them know they can participate by asking questions by using the Q&A button at the bottom of the Zoom screen.
- I will introduce myself and the class and then invite the first group to begin presenting.
- The other team should have their mics and cameras off at this time.
- The first group will present and then I will moderate questions for them.
- I will invite the second group to present.
- The other team should have their mics and cameras off at this time.
- The second group will present and then I will moderate questions for them.
- We will conclude the presentation by thanking the attendees and then I will ask you all to pop back into our class channel for a wrap-up.

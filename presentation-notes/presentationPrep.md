# Notes for your FIRST Final Presentation

## Slide template
- Here is a template you can use for slides. Feel free to modify this if any of you are talented in this area. https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1W_xWfogLKJHZolMm_-wzo6SJ0iheTPTKBO8ADHEqPKg/edit?usp=sharing

## Tips for a polished presentation - general
- split talking time evenly if possible
- Know what portions you will be presenting - be prepared
- Know who is speaking before and after you - pass the mic to the next presenter and thank the previous one "Thank you Kevin" "Next up, Michael will be demonstrating our app"
- It is ok to write a script if you need one, but try to sound natural if you are refering to a script
- Look at your camera when speaking and pretend you are speaking to someone
- Project your voice and up your energy: believe me, I know this is exhausting, but it will keep the audience engaged
- Hand gestures can be good, be animated, but try not to rock in your chair or tap or any other distracting physical behavior. 
- Try not to "umm" or "like" - minimize filler speach, if you know you do this try to slow down
- Mic off when not talking, and camera off when your team is not presenting
- **DO NOT READ YOUR SLIDES** Use the slide as a bullet point and talk about the bullet point... I will demonstrate: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17mxYBAKPGCJwfT_glpJBMmgKuNoryoRaR-qdsodog3E/edit#slide=id.g87388cdd1b_2_53
- Make sure your bed is made, your background in uncluttered

## Tips for a polished presentation - slide/sections
- When demoing your project, tell me what is going on behind the scenes, in the code. "When we click this button, the user is allowed to retrieve their previous entries from local storage..."
- Use less words on your slides and give more details when you're talking about the slides instead. You don't want to force the audience to choose between reading your slides and listening to what you are saying. Keep the wording on the slides short and talk about the details of that slide instead.
- You will be doing your 60 second pitch so be prepared - either have your script memorized or put it somewhere you can read it while looking at the camera in general
- When talking about "challenges" frame them as things you overcame - focus on the solution

## Fun extras
- coordinated team backgrounds or outfits are always fun

### we will practice presentations thursday early afternoon to give you a chance to work on them more if needed
